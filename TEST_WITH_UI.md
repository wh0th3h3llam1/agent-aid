# 🧪 Testing with Chat UI

## ✅ Your System is Ready!

Both services are running:
- ✅ Claude Service: http://localhost:3000
- ✅ LangChain Coordinator: Polling every 3 seconds

---

## 🌐 Step 1: Open Chat UI

The Chat UI should already be open in your browser at:
**http://localhost:3000/chat.html**

If not, click here or paste in browser: http://localhost:3000/chat.html

## 📝 Step 2: Test Messages

Try these test messages in the chat UI:

### Test 1: Critical Priority
```

Need 200 blankets immediately. 500 people affected. 
Life-threatening situation! Contact: 555-1234
```

**Expected**: Priority = CRITICAL ⚠️

### Test 2: High Priority
```

About 100 people waiting. Please send ASAP.

```

**Expected**: Priority = HIGH 🔶

### Test 3: Medium Priority
```

## 👀 Step 3: Watch the Coordinator

In your terminal where the coordinator is running, you'll see:

## 📊 Step 4: Check the Response

In the Chat UI, you should see:

```
✅ Request received!

Request ID: REQ-1234567890
Items: blankets
Priority: CRITICAL

I'm coordinating with suppliers now. 
You'll see quotes within 10-15 seconds...
```

2. **Claude Service** receives and stores request
3. **LangChain Coordinator** polls and finds new message
4. **Claude AI** analyzes and detects priority
5. **Coordinator** forwards to Fetch.ai Need Agent
6. **Need Agent** broadcasts to Supply Agents
7. **Supply Agents** send quotes back

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Chat UI not loading?
```bash
# Check if Claude service is running
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### No response in Chat UI?
- Check terminal for coordinator logs
- Verify coordinator is running (should show polling messages)

### Coordinator not seeing messages?
- The coordinator polls every 3 seconds
- Wait a few seconds after submitting

---

## 🎯 Quick Test Command

Or test via command line:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/extract \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input":"Emergency! Need 100 blankets in SF. 200 people.","source":"chat"}'
```

Watch the coordinator terminal for the analysis!
