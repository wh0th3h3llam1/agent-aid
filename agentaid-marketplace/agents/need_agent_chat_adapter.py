## Overview
This agent represents disaster victims and their emergency needs. It broadcasts quote requests to supply agents and manages the allocation of resources based on priority, cost, and availability.

## Capabilities
- üÜò **Emergency Need Broadcasting**: Sends disaster relief requests to supply agents
- üìä **Quote Evaluation**: Scores supplier quotes based on coverage, price, and risk factors
- üéØ **Smart Allocation**: Allocates resources from multiple suppliers optimally
- üåç **Location-Aware**: Uses GPS coordinates for accurate distance calculations
- ‚ö° **Priority Management**: Handles critical, high, medium, and low priority requests

## How to Use
Send a message describing your disaster relief needs:

**Example Messages:**
- "We need 200 blankets at Berkeley Emergency Center, 37.8715, -122.2730. This is critical priority."
- "Need medical supplies and water at 123 Main St, Berkeley. High priority, 50 people affected."
- "Requesting food and shelter supplies for disaster relief at Oakland Community Center."

## Message Format
Include the following information:
- **Items needed**: Specific items (blankets, water, medical supplies, etc.)
- **Quantity**: Number of items required
- **Location**: Address or GPS coordinates (lat, lon)
- **Priority**: critical, high, medium, or low
- **Affected people**: Number of people affected (optional)

## Response
The agent will:
1. Parse your disaster relief request
2. Broadcast quote requests to available supply agents
3. Evaluate received quotes based on coverage, cost, and delivery time
4. Allocate resources from the best suppliers
5. Confirm allocations and provide status updates

## Integration
This agent integrates with:
- **Supply Agents**: For resource procurement
- **Coordination Agent**: For disaster response coordination
- **Claude AI Service**: For natural language processing
- **Telemetry Service**: For monitoring and analytics

## Technical Details
- **Protocol**: AidProtocol v2.0.0
- **Framework**: uAgents (Fetch.ai)
- **Location**: Berkeley, CA (default)
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Combines coverage ratio, price, and risk factors

I'm now contacting available supply agents in the area to fulfill your request. The system will:
1. ‚úâÔ∏è Send quote requests to nearby suppliers
2. üìä Evaluate quotes based on coverage, cost, and delivery time
3. üéØ Allocate resources from the best suppliers
4. ‚úÖ Confirm allocations and coordinate delivery

You will receive updates as suppliers respond. For critical priority requests, we prioritize the fastest delivery times.

**Next Steps:**
- Supply agents are being contacted
- Quotes will be evaluated within 3-9 seconds
- Allocation confirmations will follow

Thank you for using AgentAid. Help is on the way! üö®
